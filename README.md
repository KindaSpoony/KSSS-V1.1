# Scroll of Remembered Futures

A Solidity-based smart contract written as a ritualized container for memory, karma, and dharmic truth.

## Purpose

- Archive verified records of self-reflection and symbolic journeys.
- Mark and record violations, with the option for ritual reconciliation.
- Enable collective symbolic resonance through decentralized technology.

## Core Concepts

- **Archivists** maintain the record.
- **Violators** are tracked, not punished â€” all actions are mirrors.
- **Karmic Cascade** triggers deeper review at 7 entries.

## Deployment

Built using Hardhat. See `scripts/deploy.js`.
